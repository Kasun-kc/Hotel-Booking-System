# Hotel Booking System

## Introduction

The **Hotel Booking System** is a Python-based project designed to streamline hotel operations using **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** principles. It simplifies the management of room availability, guest reservations, and customer data, providing a scalable and efficient solution for hotels.

This project includes a **Class Diagram** to outline the system architecture and a Python implementation of the booking system, making it easy to understand and extend for future needs such as payment integration and reporting.

## Features

- **Room Management**: Add, update, and manage room details like availability and pricing.
- **Guest Management**: Handle guest profiles and track booking history.
- **Reservation System**: Book, cancel, or modify reservations based on room availability.
- **Extensible Design**: Built using OOD principles for easy customization and extension.

## Key Entities

The system is designed around the following key entities:

- **Hotel**: Represents the hotel and manages its rooms, guests, and reservations.
- **Room**: Holds information about individual rooms, such as room number, type (e.g., single, double), and price.
- **Guest**: Stores guest details like name, contact information, and reservation history.
- **Reservation**: Manages booking details, including check-in and check-out dates, assigned room, and guest information.
